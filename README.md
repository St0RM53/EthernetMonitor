# EthernetMonitor

![icon](./icon.png) <!-- Optional: Replace with actual path or badge -->

**EthernetMonitor** is a lightweight Windows system tray utility that monitors your Ethernet adapter's link speed and notifies you if it drops below an expected threshold. It’s useful for power users, gamers, and network administrators who want to be alerted of degraded network conditions due to faulty cables, auto-negotiation failures, or hardware issues.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Monitors a specific network interface** (e.g., "Ethernet") for status and link speed.
- 🔔 **Displays native Windows 10/11 toast notifications** when the speed drops below a configured threshold.
- 🎛️ **Fully configurable via a tray menu**:
  - Select network adapter
  - Set expected link speed
  - Adjust monitoring and notification intervals
  - Toggle autostart on system boot
- 📁 Configuration stored in `config.json` (auto-generated)
- 🪟 Minimal, icon-based tray presence with dynamic icon change on warning
- 📜 Log file (`ethernet_monitor.log`) for activity and error tracking

## 🧭 First-Time Usage Guide

When you run the program for the first time, a tray icon will appear:

- 🟢 **Green icon** – Ethernet is running at or above the expected speed.
- 🔴 **Red icon** – Speed is lower than expected or connection is down.

### Right-click the tray icon to open the menu. Here's what each option does:

| **Menu Option**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Current: <interface>`             | Displays the currently monitored network adapter.                              |
| `Select Interface`                 | Lists all detected network interfaces. Click to switch monitoring target.      |
| `Expected Speed`                   | Choose the minimum link speed (e.g., 1000 Mbps) you expect from your adapter.  |
| `Expected: <speed>`                | Displays your currently set expected speed.                                    |
| `Current Link Speed:`              | Shows the current link speed of the selected adapter.                          |
| `Check Interval`                   | Frequency (in seconds or minutes) to check the adapter status.                 |
| `Notification Interval`            | How often to show speed warnings (prevents spamming).                          |
| `Open Config Folder`               | Opens the folder where `config.json` and log files are stored.                 |
| `Start with Windows`               | Enable/disable automatic start when Windows boots.                             |
| `About`                            | Shows version info and credits.                                                |
| `GitHub Repository`                | Opens the project GitHub page in your browser.                                 |
| `Quit`                             | Exits the application and removes tray icon.                                   |

## 🛠️ Configuration File

Located at `config.json`, it stores your preferences. Example structure:

```json
{
  "interface_name": "Ethernet",
  "expected_speed_mbps": 1000,
  "check_interval_seconds": 60,
  "notification_interval_seconds": 60,
  "start_with_windows": false
}
```

You normally don’t need to edit this manually – use the tray menu instead.

---

## 🛡️ Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.10+ (only for development; end-users can use compiled `.exe`)
- Libraries (included in packaged build):
  - `psutil`
  - `pystray`
  - `Pillow`
  - `winotify`
  - `pywin32`
  - `winshell`

---

## 🧰 Building from Source (Optional)

To build your own `.exe` using PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon=ethernet_monitor_icon.ico ethernet_monitor.py
```

If you're using `.png` icons or external files, you may need to update the `.spec` file to include them.

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **No notification shows up?**
  - Ensure you're on Windows 10 or 11.
  - Make sure `ethernet_monitor_icon.ico` is present in the same directory.
  - Check `ethernet_monitor.log` for errors.
- **Tray icon disappears after notification?**
  - Use `winotify` instead of `win10toast_click`, which causes `WNDPROC` errors.
